So instead of responding to each message, I have spent some time and prepared detailed posts📝Hope it will help you with the right preparations🤞

ℹ️ After reviewing some past Microsoft interviews experiences, I found that Microsoft asked mainly questions from the following section:

📚 Computer Fundamentals
📚 Data Structures & Algorithm
📚 System Design (HLD & LLD)

🔨Lets me explain in detail the strategies and resources for each section.

📚 Computer Fundamentals:

I have gone through all the important concepts of OS, OOPS, DBMS, and Networking.

📚 Data Structures & Algorithm(DSA):
 
⚠️In Microsoft, questions are asked from all the data structures so don't SKIP any.
  
I mainly prepared from LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and the self-prepared DSA notes that you can download from my Telegram channel👉https://lnkd.in/gYXf3VxK

✅I tried to solve questions in order of brute force to best-optimized solutions.

✅For each question, First I tried to write algo/code on paper, and after verifying it then only write code on the machine.

✅Kept making notes of important questions.

✅After each chapter, I used to give Mock Interviews (In-person & Online) to test my knowledge.

✅After the mock Interviews, I felt that I am lacking in Dynamic Programming and Graphs concepts so spend extra time on these two topics to make them strong.

📚 System Design (High-Level Design):

✅First I learned the key components of the system design (like Load balancing, Sharing, Data partitioning, Polling, etc) then start going through some problems.

✅I took help from the following resources in system design interview preparations:-

🔗https://lnkd.in/g-mykjtD
🔗https://lnkd.in/gWrgQ_cY
🔗https://lnkd.in/gjbwtY2H

✅System design questions are very open-ended, every person approaches them differently but by following the above resources you will get a good idea about what standard way to approach them. 

✅I used to give mock interviews and discuss system design questions with my friends which really helped me to understand how to approach system design questions and also learned things in depth.

✅I have gone through 20-25 real-time system design questions which really helped me.

📚 System Design (Low-Level Design):

For low-level design, I read the "Gang of Four" Design Pattern book and then solved a couple of problems that really helped me.

ℹ️Be consistent during preparations.

ℹ️Revision of past topics is really important, I tried to spend 20% of my time revising the previous and 80% on the current topics.

ℹ️Go for quality preparation rather than quantity as there is no fixed set of questions.
